Machine Learning classification model made to predict if customers are likely to stop using a fictional company's service.

The model predicts a customer's churn value, 1 if they're likely to stop using the service, and 0 if not.

Three different types of models were used for this same purpose, them being:
 - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN);
 - Bernoulli Na√Øve Bayes;
 - Decision Tree.
